## Inspiration

This application's interface was completely borrowed from Maulana Farhan's [Task Management App](https://dribbble.com/shots/15718338-Task-Management-App-Project-Management) design. All credit for the graphic design used in this project goes to him. Feel free to check out his other works [on dribbble](https://dribbble.com/maulanafaa).

The illustration used in the welcome screen was designed by [Cami](https://dribbble.com/camidobrin).

## Fork & Setup

While this project can be adapted to use any cloud-based storage solution, it currently implements Firebase's cloud firestore as its primary cloud storage solution. To properly setup and run this project, you must include your own Firebase GoogleService-Info.plist and google-services.json files for iOS and Android deployment respectively.

For instructions on setting up a Firebase application and cloud firestore, visit the [Firebase website](firebase.google.com).
